      <description>Long time ago, I was wondering: is it ever possible to write Common Lisp code on my Android phone? It seems useful when I want to experiment with something on the train.  I found this application: CL REPL - Google Play.  It is actually an ECL bundled with ASDF and Slime, in a traditional Android application, as you might imagine. It is a great application, but it still lacks some useful features compared with SLIME/SLY.</description>
